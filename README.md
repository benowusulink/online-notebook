# Web app Name

Online Notebook Client

## General website information

This is the client for a full stack application which
includes an API server and database.

The client for this app is a notebook which first allows you
to create an account and login, create as many notes as you want
and store it within the app via the database and then logout.

The notes you save will persist as there is datasbase as mentioned
before so after you logout and log back in the data will last.

The aim when creating the client side of this application was to
take advantage of React and Javascript features, focusing in
particular on re using react components and handling data requested
and received by an API into a single page application.

## Programming Languages and tools used

   features of a path between client, server and database
